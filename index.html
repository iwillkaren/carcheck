    <h2>Why Is It Important to Avoid Stolen or Finance-Encumbered Cars?</h2>
<p>Purchasing a stolen vehicle or one with outstanding finance can have serious consequences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Legal ownership issues:</strong> You might not legally own the car, risking repossession.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Financial loss:</strong> You could lose money if the vehicle is seized or you have to repay finance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Safety concerns:</strong> Stolen cars may have hidden damage or tampering.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Resale problems:</strong> Selling a car with unresolved finance or theft history is difficult.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Avoiding these risks requires reliable, up-to-date information about the vehicle's background - which is exactly what CarVeto provides.</p>
<h2>How CarVeto Works: A Step-by-Step Overview</h2>
<h2>1. Enter the Vehicle Registration Number</h2>
<p>CarVeto's process starts with the vehicle's registration number (VRM). This simple input unlocks access to a wealth of verified data from official UK sources.</p>
<h2>2. Access the Free Basic Check</h2>
<p>The free check instantly reveals key details such as MOT status, road tax, emissions, and export or SORN flags. This quick screening helps identify obvious red flags early in your search.</p>
<h2>3. Upgrade to the Premium or Platinum Check</h2>
<p>For full protection, CarVeto's paid reports dig deeper, uncovering hidden risks including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Outstanding finance or logbook loans</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stolen vehicle alerts from police databases</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write-off and salvage classifications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ownership and keeper history</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mileage anomalies and cloned plate detection</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>With over 80 validated data points, these reports provide a comprehensive risk assessment backed by a £30,000 data guarantee.</p>
<h2>Key Features That Protect You from Stolen or Finance-Encumbered Cars</h2>
<h2>Stolen Vehicle Checks</h2>
<p>CarVeto cross-references the Police National Computer and Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register to identify if a car is flagged as stolen or involved in theft investigations. This ensures you won't unknowingly buy a stolen vehicle.</p>
<h2>Outstanding Finance Detection</h2>
<p>Using Experian's Asset Register, CarVeto reveals if there is any active finance agreement on the vehicle, such as loans or leases. Buying a car with outstanding finance can lead to repossession by the finance company.</p>
<h2>Write-Off and Salvage Status</h2>
<p>Insurance write-offs are categorized (Cat A, B, S, N) and flagged in CarVeto's report, alerting you to vehicles that have been seriously damaged or rebuilt. This protects you from hidden structural or safety issues.</p>
<h2>Ownership and Keeper History</h2>
<p>CarVeto tracks all previous owners and changes in registration, helping you verify the vehicle's history and detect suspicious plate transfers or re-registrations that might hide a vehicle's true past.</p>
<h2>Mileage and Lifecycle Analysis</h2>
<p>Mileage discrepancies can indicate odometer fraud. CarVeto compares MOT, lease, and service mileage records to highlight inconsistencies, ensuring you pay a fair price.</p>
